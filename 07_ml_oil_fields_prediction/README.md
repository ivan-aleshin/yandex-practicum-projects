## Exploration of New Oil Fields Regions Using ML Models

### Task
Selecting the most profitable regions for oil extraction. Develop ML model to determine the area where drilling will be the most profitable with the least risk of loss.  

### Description
An oil company needs to make decion on developing the next well location. The existing data is oil samples' characteristics for varoius wells. Data contains oil quality parametres and oil reserves information in three regions. Characteristics of each well in the region are already known.
A machine learning model forecasts oil reserves in new wells. The model assists in picking the region with most profitable set of wells to be drilled.
Part of the research is potential profit and risk assessment using Bootstrap methodology.
