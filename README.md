## Optimization of electricity consumption in industry

### Project Goal
Optimization of electricity consumption at the steel plant by develop a ML model for predicting steel temperature.  

### Project Description
Given data from various indicators of a steel plant.
The task is to develop ML model to predict final temperature of steel with MAE at least 6.8.  

Exploring the available data, it types, missings, duplicates, basic statistics, plot graphs.  
Data was cleaned and preprocessed. Some missings in data was filled some data had to be deleted. 
Then data was aggregated from 7 different tables to the one. 10 new features was generated.
Three different ML models were trained and tuned on cross-validation with feature transformation via pipeline. After determining the best model, we've evaluated the importance of the features. Three ifferent methods was used to explore feature importances. Based on the study of feature importances a new lightweight model was developed with only 10 features and MAE below 5.4.
