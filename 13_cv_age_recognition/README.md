## Age Recognition Using CV Deep Learning Model

### Task
Develop a CV model to recognise an age of customers by their photo.

### Description
Supermarket chain Bread&Salt introduces a computer vision system for processing customer's photos. Photo fixation at checkout area will help to determine the age of customers in order to:  
- Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
- Control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol;
- Security reasons.

Study summary:
THe exploratory analysis was conducted first. There are not many photos were available. Therefore the augumentation was implemented.
The pretrained Resnet-102 neural network model was finetuned for the purpose of stidy. The last two layers of model were replaced, respectively, with a connected layer with one output neuron and leaky ReLU activation. The final value of the MAE metric on the validation sample was 5.91.
